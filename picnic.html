                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        I cannot personally recommend Endcliffe park enough with its ideal location
                        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/dob9AyVkqSVjZv6b9">right next to the accommodation in Endcliffe village, </a>
                        it's the perfect place to hang out with your mates, relax in on one of the benches
                        or even go for a run if that's more your thing.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Food</h3>
                    <p>
                        There is a huge selection of independent restaurants and cafes for you to explore
                        in the nearby Ecclesall road with big names such as Dominos and KFC
                        and local secrets such as Mowgli Street Food, you will be sure to find something that you like.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
                    <p>
                        What you might have not known is that the park was opened in 1887 to commemorate the jubilee of Queen Victoria,
                        complete with multiple monuments of the queen and even a tree planted by the Lord mayor of Sheffield.

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        The botanical gardens are <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/C9j284676wZM7WWr6">pretty close by to Endcliffe park, </a>
                        so if you want a little adventure without having to stray too far from home,
                        it's the perfect place to visit. With its wonderful scenery,
                        you will be sure to enjoy having a bite to eat while admiring the gardens.

                    <h3>Food</h3>
                    <p>
                        While you still have Ecclesall road, there is also an amazing cafe that has some of the best coffee around,
                        which would be perfect to get you though the rest of the day after coming home from uni
                        or just as a nice treat while basking in the sunlight.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's a little known fact that way back in  1833, the Sheffield Botanical and Horticultural Society
                        decided to establish a botanical garden, and so Robert Marnock went out and won a competition to design the garden.

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you happen to be a Uni of Sheffield student, then you must have heard of Weston park by now,
                        as it's only a <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/wCraaiBamVwPpFrQ8">stones throw away from the main campus, </a>
                        so if your ever considering bunking a lecture on a nice sunny day then at least do so in the company of ducks and flowers.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Food</h3>
                    <p>
                        In terms of food, there's more options than you could possibly desire,
                        with West street only being a couple of minutes away on foot,
                        there's no shortage of fast food available on demand at competitive prices,
                        even a university student could afford.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
                    <p>
                        What you may not know is that Weston park was actually the first public park in Sheffield,
                        developed from the grounds of Weston Hall which was a private home built over two hundred years ago
                        in 1795 which shows just how much history there is behind the city of Sheffield.

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you love Weston park, then you will be glad to know that there's
                        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/2zGSbZoVLkoeAobH6">another park close by, </a>
                        with even more green space than you could ever want. Considering the huge amount of just space,
                        if you wanted to escape into nature and just relax, then I think this is the perfect place for you.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Food</h3>
                    <p>
                        Considering that it is a little far from the high street, you could go to Dam house
                        which is a little restaurant very close by. However, if you bring your own food,
                        then you and a couple of friends could have a chilled picnic on the grass,
                        close to the lake that's home to ducks and other wildlife.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Old Great Dam was built all the way back in 1785 and was one of ten,
                        built to supply water to Sheffield. While it was considered obsolete by the 20th century,
                        Dam House which used to be the home of the water Company Solicitor, is now a local restaurant.
